## **Project Description**
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize medical examination data to identify trends and correlations between health metrics. The dataset includes information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Height
- Weight
- Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
- Cholesterol levels
- Glucose levels
- Smoking status
- Alcohol consumption
- Physical activity

The project includes:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Calculating BMI and categorizing overweight status.
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - A categorical plot (`catplot`) showing the distribution of health metrics.
   - A heatmap showing correlations between variables.
